Cheese Cake is a magical dessert that was developed in Ancient Greece, Europe. This dessert is made of layers of delight. The first layer consists of a thick, creamy mixture made of cream cheese. The second layer consists of crispy crust ususally made of graham crackers and butter. Cheese cake is a simple recipe that leads to and enchanted, creamy delight!
