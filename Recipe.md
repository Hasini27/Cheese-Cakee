Preparing the crust:
Grind the graham crackers and pecans into a powder-like consistency. The pecans will give the crust a nice, crispy, almost rustic taste. Add the brown sugar and salt to the mixture and grind it once again. After grinding the dry ingredients, you will notice that the mixture is too dry to form the crust. This is when the unsalted butter comes into the picture. The butter will give it a smoother and kneedable texture so we can form the crust. Pour the mixture into the pan and spread it evenly. Place the pan in the refrigerator and let it harden for 15-20 minutes.

Whip the whipping cream:
Whip the whipping cream and the powdered sugar together in a mixer (or by hand) until stiff peaks form on top.

Make the cream cheese filling:
Blend the cream cheese alone until it becomes creamy and soft. Add the sugar and condensed milk and beat it on a medium speed until the sugar is completely mixed in with the cream cheese. Add the sour cream, condensed milk and the vanilla essence to the mixture and beat it again.

Mix the cream cheese with the whipped cream:
After both of the whipped cream and cream cheese fillings are ready, mix them in together until both of them make fluffy, creamy mixture. 

Pour the cream cheese in the pan:
After the filling has been prepped, pour the cream cheese filling in to the pan and spread it around evenly until there is a smooth layer of cream cheese. Place the pan inside the refrigerator and freeze it overnight or for 7-8 hours.

Decoration:
After the cream cheese is completely set, it's time to add the best part, the decorations! You can use fruit, chocolate, caramel and other toppings but if you're going for a classic cheese cake, add fruits to the cheesecake. 

Enjoy!
A tip to always get perfect cuts on a cheesecake is to damp the knife every time before cutting it.
